2019-03-17,Queer Film Challenge 2018,"queer, queerchallenge, challenge",https://boxd.it/2INig,"I had such a fun time curating and participating in the 2017 Queer Challenge this year so I figured why not continue on with a new one this year. I did some tinkering here and there and I'm really satisfied with this grouping of challenges. So join in and make your own lists! Comment with them below and make sure to include the link to this list so others can join in easily.

There are no stipulations as to what you can pick for the challenge. Of course you want to focus on queer-centred films, but of course queer context can be found in the most surprising places. There's an important skill to hone in on when doing this challenge and that's evaluating qualities of good and bad queer film and the different tropes present in so many queer films. It's doing this personal study for myself on queer film that has made me absolutely passionate about the genre.

While you aren't forced to go in the suggested order, it's nice to see everyone's views on each week's subject and how they intercross with one another. When logging a film, make sure to state the challenge, the week and tag it with ""queerchallenge18"".

Lastly have fun with your films. There's a zillion choices to pick from. If you have trouble finding something, there are plenty of films to be found in the lists provided in weeks 1, 2, 15 and 51.

When you complete the list, comment below and I'll add your list to the masterlist. I think I've covered everything. Questions, comments, compliments and concerns can also be left in the comments below.
