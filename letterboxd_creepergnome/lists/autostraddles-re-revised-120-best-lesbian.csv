1,But I'm a Cheerleader,1999,https://boxd.it/1CW4,"""We‚Äôre surprised that the critics didn‚Äôt fall for this charming, campy, smart and timeless lesbian movie because we sure did. But I‚Äôm a Cheerleader is so many things: a cute love story, an exploration of the coming out experience, a delightfully wacky take on the real-life horrors of gay conversion therapy and, above all, hilarious. It‚Äôs also legendary for its battle with the MPAA, who wanted to slap an NC-17 on the film ‚Äôcause apparently girl-on-girl culture and female masturbation are downright obscene. After a few rounds of edits, it earned an R, hit movie theaters, and began its legendary claim on our hearts."""
2,Carol,2015,https://boxd.it/7DPK,"""It‚Äôs based on Patricia Highsmith‚Äôs novel The Price of Salt, and the only reason it didn‚Äôt win the Academy Award for Best Picture is because it doesn‚Äôt focus on the feelings or pleasure of one single man for one single second. Waterloo!"""
3,Saving Face,2004,https://boxd.it/1Fj0,"""A multi-generational romantic comedy about a lesbian surgeon and her pregnant, unwed mother trying to find the courage to follow their hearts instead of their family‚Äôs expectations. There is nothing to dislike about this movie and if you haven‚Äôt seen it, you should remedy that immediately."""
4,Circumstance,2011,https://boxd.it/g4i,"""In Tehran, Atafeh and her orphaned best friend, Shireen, fall in love, despite her brother‚Äôs growing obsession with Shireen and the religious beliefs of her family. This story is full of youth but also sexuality, and family and rules and an underworld where people can be who they are. The two girls at the center are being torn really strongly in a few directions, sometimes almost violently so, but can‚Äôt seem to untangle from each other or from their familial obligations."""
5,Show Me Love,1998,https://boxd.it/1TmW,"""In the small town of Amal, Sweden, two girls with very different personalities find that they have a pretty big thing in common. (Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs liking girls.) Elin is a popular, social butterfly. Agnes is an openly gay depressed recluse. The two of them decide to take a five-hour ride to Stockholm to solve all their problems, and fall in love along the way."""
6,Pariah,2011,https://boxd.it/2wWk,"""Despite violent opposition from her mother, who wants her daughter to dress femininely and be straight, 17-year-old Alike prefers to express herself with androgynous clothes and liking girls. When her mother refuses to accept her, she has to choose between staying and trying to gain her mother‚Äôs approval or leaving for college early to start a new life."""
7,Freeheld,2015,https://boxd.it/9OzM,"""This tearjerker tells the true story of Laurel Hester, a New Jersey police detective diagnosed with cancer who is prohibited from leaving her pension to her domestic partner, car mechanic Stacie. They take their case to court, struggle for equality, and look real cute together."""
8,Bessie,2015,https://boxd.it/aPFe,"‚Äú'Bessie is the role of a lifetime for Queen Latifah,' wrote Gabby Rivera in her review. 'She‚Äôs never been more poised, emotionally raw and free in her skin in any other role.' In Dee Rees‚Äô biopic about the most popular female blues singer of pre-Depression America, Bessie‚Äôs relationships with women aren‚Äôt glossed over or pushed aside."""
9,Aimee & Jaguar,1999,https://boxd.it/27by,"""Set in Berlin during World War II, Aimee & Jaguar is a fictional account of the real lives of Lilly Wust and Felice Schragenheim. One is a Jewish mother working with an underground organization to fight the Nazis; the other is the wife of a Nazi soldier. Their relationship is intense and wonderful and unspeakably tragic. You‚Äôll have to watch Imagine Me & You ten times after you watch this to feel better."""
10,Bound,1996,https://boxd.it/1Z1g,"""Violet and Corky decide the best way to be together and break free from their pasts is to steal $2 million of mafia money. The plot and the violence are cartoonishly over the top, but the lesbian sex scenes are for real. They were choreographed by the legendary Susie Bright, who received a cameo in the film for her help teaching Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon how to scissor."""
11,The Handmaiden,2016,https://boxd.it/948A,"""Inspired by Sarah Waters‚Äô 'Fingersmith,' this highly-decorated seductive thriller takes place in 1930s-era colonial Korean and Japan, where a young woman on a secluded estate develops a sexual relationship with her new handmaiden."""
12,With Every Heartbeat,2011,https://boxd.it/2vSc,"""Oh, you know, just your average 33-year-old straight-engaged woman who accidentally falls in love with her soon-to-be stepsister when she meets her for the very first time. Mia‚Äôs dumb boyfriend Tim never stood a chance."""
13,Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,2017,https://boxd.it/eRPS,"""Writer/director/longtime lesbian favorite Angela Robinson did a really subversive thing with the most talked-about period film of the fall of 2017: she brought an ardent screenplay, a soaring score, and unapologetically gauzy sunlight to bear on the story of the man, his wife, and their lover who created the most iconic female superhero of all time in the hopes that she would prepare the world for matriarchal rule ‚Äî with a healthy side of bondage."""
14,Battle of the Sexes,2017,https://boxd.it/cNxw,"""It‚Äôs a comedy about a charming, washed-up, middle-aged gambling addict looking for a little notoriety and one more hustle. It‚Äôs a period drama about a group of women athletes trying to get equal pay and a little respect. It‚Äôs a sports movie, complete with breathless action sequences, overwrought crowd reactions, and a soaring score. It‚Äôs a biopic about a legend. And it‚Äôs one of the best lesbian films we‚Äôve ever seen."""
15,Suicide Kale,2016,https://boxd.it/dZm8,"""Jasmine and Penn, a brand-new couple, find themselves at a very confusing lunch when they find a suicide note beneath the mattress of their hosts, Jordan and Billie. This funny fresh feature was shot in a few days on no budget, which says a lot about the raw talent on display here."""
16,Gia,1998,https://boxd.it/1NUo,"""Like so many lesbian movies on this list, this HBO biographical film about model Gia Marie Carangi is sexy and sweet and also harrowing and miserable. The love scene between Elizabeth Mitchell and Angelina Jolie, though, is one for the record books. It‚Äôs the reason half the lesbians over the age of 35 realized they‚Äôre gay."""
17,The Hours,2002,https://boxd.it/2a3s,"""Based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning book by Michael Cunningham, The Hours uses ‚ÄúMrs. Dalloway‚Äù as a point of connection for three interconnected stories happening in three different time periods, including Virginia Woolf‚Äôs own."""
18,Dope,2015,https://boxd.it/9Tho,"""Kiersy Clemons co-stars as Diggy, the masculine-presenting lesbian best friend of protagonist Malcom and their other bestie, Jib. Together, the trio of ‚Äô90s-loving geeks used to getting bullied on the daily are invited to a cool party hosted by drug dealers, setting off a chain of events that get the kids in real deep with criminal activity and unsavory characters with no awareness of their own ridiculousness. It‚Äôs a charming, entirely original, politically conscious coming-of-age tale cast in dreamy California light and draped in eye-popping fashion with a killer soundtrack to boot."""
19,Princess Cyd,2017,https://boxd.it/gewQ,"""A character study of two women who clumsily and gently brush up against each other and find new happiness because of it ‚Äî and in the process, one of them simply realizes she likes girls."""
20,V for Vendetta,2005,https://boxd.it/29Ik,"""The lesbian love story between Valerie and Ruth, persecuted for their sexual orientation, is what inspires a closeted gay television host to start a revolution that is eventually finished by Natalie Portman‚Äôs Evey. In a dramatic departure from the usual state of affairs, the film amped up, rather than toned down, the source material‚Äôs queerness."""
21,Imagine Me & You,2005,https://boxd.it/28E2,"""In a sea of depressing, soul-crushing lesbian films, Imagine Me & You stands alone as the mainstream rom-com where the girl gets the girl. Even the straight dudes are good guys in this movie!"""
22,Atomic Blonde,2017,https://boxd.it/blDk,"""A stylish ‚Äúhigh-stakes, global action-thriller‚Äù about spies that sees Charlize Theron kicking a lot of men, rocking incredible hair, and having a genuine relationship with another hot tough girl. It‚Äôs definitely a certain type of movie ‚Äî high-stakes, global action-thriller about spies ‚Äî but even if that‚Äôs not your jam, it‚Äôs sexy as hell, and pretty incredible for a film like this to have a bisexual protagonist like Lorraine."""
23,My Summer of Love,2004,https://boxd.it/1XZI,"""My Summer of Love won not only a BAFTA, but also a place in all of our hearts for casting Emily Blunt as a lesbian with some pretty intense love scenes. A twisted lesbian with a warped sense of a good time, but some people are into that. Each to their own, ladies."""
24,Mosquita y Mari,2012,https://boxd.it/2Y6Q,"""Fans of Benjamin Alire Saenz‚Äôs Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe will love this tender, earnest story of friendship, attraction, and family."""
25,The Secrets,2007,https://boxd.it/1N5K,"""In Israel, two orthodox students fuck the patriarchy and learn a lot about themselves in the process. It‚Äôs tender and feminist and complicated and heart-wrenching and unlike any lesbian movie you‚Äôve seen before."""
26,Annihilation,2018,https://boxd.it/9yzm,"""In Annihilation, a biologist, psychologist, physicist, anthropologist, and paramedic enter the shimmer ‚Äî a mysterious and expanding sector marked by increasingly unnerving mutations ‚Äî and at some point, Gina Rodriguez steals the show as a confident nd muscly soft butch lesbian with an undercut who opens a beer bottle in that way where you slam it against a table edge with your hand."""
27,Unveiled,2005,https://boxd.it/o9U,"""An Iranian woman, Fariba, is caught having an affair with a married woman and flees to Germany to avoid using persecution, but once her forged papers are uncovered, the only way she can stay in Germany is by taking on the identity of a male refugee. And then she meets a girl. Intense and authentic love scenes ensue."""
28,Appropriate Behavior,2014,https://boxd.it/7k4U,"""Written by and starring bisexual actress Desiree Akhavan, Appropriate Behavior starts when its protagonist‚Äôs relationship ends, sending her into a spiral as she tries to figure out what she‚Äôs doing with her life and how that fits in with what her family wants for her."""
29,If These Walls Could Talk 2,2000,https://boxd.it/1qq6,"""Like the original film, this HBO-produced sequel follows the lives of three different couples who live in the same house in different time periods. Only, this time, they‚Äôre lesbians! You know that clip of Michelle Williams and Chlo√´ Sevigny making out that you always see all over Tumblr and YouTube? Yeah, that‚Äôs from this."""
30,Desert Hearts,1985,https://boxd.it/2aFc,"""This was one of the first mainstream movies to have a lesbian storyline, which means it was pretty controversial and is a bonafide CLASSIC. Based on the classic novel by Jane Rule, this understated drama is the story of straightlaced Columbia professor and divorcee Vivian, who escapes her life and ends up falling for cowgirl Cay."""
31,Life Partners,2014,https://boxd.it/7HvO,"""Leighton Meester is absolutely adorable in this comedy about two co-dependent best friends ‚Äî one straight, one gay ‚Äî who have to learn a new way to navigate their relationship after one falls in love."""
32,All Over Me,1997,https://boxd.it/1RdI,"""Ah, the ‚Äô90s. When riot grrrl was in full swing and hating your best friend (who makes out with you) for having a boyfriend was all the rage. Come for the amazing soundtrack, stay for Leisha Hailey with pink hair."""
33,The Kids Are All Right,2010,https://boxd.it/13f0,"""Nic and Jules are a successful lesbian couple living in Los Angeles with the two kids they each had from the same sperm donor. The kids track down the sperm donor and he weasels his way into their lives and into Jules‚Äô pants. The movie has a (gay) happy ending, and critics loved it. It was even nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Queer women, however, engaged in heated debates about the film all over the internet. It is loved and loathed by our community in equal measure."""
34,Margarita with a Straw,2014,https://boxd.it/8Vu8,"""'Yes, this is a ""disabled person discovers their sexuality"" movie, but Laila is never healed (literally or figuratively) by that discovery,' wrote Carrie Wade in her review of Margarita With a Straw, a love story between two disabled women of color, 'presented without sensationalism or pandering.'"""
35,The Runaways,2010,https://boxd.it/1rsC,"""Based on Cherrie Curie‚Äôs memoir Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway, the film explores the relationship between Currie and Joan Jett during the time they spent together on the road in their all-girl 1970s rockband. It passes The Bechdel Test many times over."""
36,Grandma,2015,https://boxd.it/9V00,"""Lily Tomlin plays Elle, a writer and academic who spends a day with her granddaughter triyng to find $600 for an emergency abortion directly after breaking up with her much younger girlfriend. Lily Tomlin shines, because Lily Tomlin always shines, because she is perfect."""
37,Drifting Flowers,2008,https://boxd.it/2oh4,"""Drifting Flowers seamlessly weaves together three stories‚Äîstories of love, of jealousy, of loss, to create a lush and visually stunning film. It can edge towards clich√© at times, but it‚Äôs filled with so many tender and funny moments that a little clich√© is easy to forgive."""
38,Pride,2014,https://boxd.it/6TwM,"""A British historical dramedy based on the true story of LGBT activists who came together to support British miners during their 1984 strike. The B-story of the film focuses on the real-life activist group, Lesbians Against Pit Closures."""
39,The Watermelon Woman,1996,https://boxd.it/RRc,"""The Watermelon Woman is the first feature film to be directed by an out black lesbian, which is reason enough to give it a shot. But beyond that, it‚Äôs a warm and sexy film that explores several lesbian relationships while peeling back some of the layers of how we think about race, how we have historically thought about race, and the intersectionality of both of those with queer culture. Not too bad for a film made with a $300,000 budget."""
40,Stranger Inside,2001,https://boxd.it/TT0,"""Stranger Inside is a hard, gritty, look at life inside a women‚Äôs correctional facility, and it‚Äôs not all Norma toast and Laverne Cox doing your hair. I won‚Äôt spoil the ending for you, but it almost made me miss Piper."""
41,The Fish Child,2009,https://boxd.it/1t0A,"""La Guayi is working as a live-in maid for Lala‚Äôs wealthy Argentinean family when Lala falls in love with her ‚Äî and grows increasingly jealous of and angry at La Guayi‚Äôs other paramours. When Lala‚Äôs father is killed and Lala flees her home in search of La Guayi, she begins learning the truth about the girl she‚Äôs so obsessed with. Based on Luc√≠a Puenzo‚Äôs novel of the same name, the film is a dark and engrossing drama."""
42,Codependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same,2012,https://boxd.it/3zUy,"""It‚Äôs super weird and super super smart. Even after it‚Äôs over, you‚Äôre not sure what you watched, but you‚Äôre glad you watched it."""
43,D.E.B.S.,2004,https://boxd.it/2aaS,"""Carly said of this queer take on a crime caper, 'D.E.B.S. is like the Little Engine That Could of lezzy films. D.E.B.S.‚Äôs small budget and subsequent green screen overdose gives it a campy and silly look which I totally love. The script and the acting are decent and the soundtrack is fantastic. Unfortunately it‚Äôs pretty tame as far as the girl-on-girl action goes, but what we do see is adorable and feels realistic. Did I mention Jordana Brewster? Yow. If you like girls with guns, you‚Äôll love this coming-of-age girl-meets-girl love story, set amongst spy missions and national security.'"""
44,High Art,1998,https://boxd.it/17Sg,"""Syd‚Äôs boyfriend James isn‚Äôt nearly as intriguing as the tragically talented lesbian drug addict photographer Lucy who lives in her building ‚Äî with her girlfriend, German actress Greta. A relationship between Syd and Lucy begins brewing, changing both of their lives forever."""
45,Boy Meets Girl,2015,https://boxd.it/7Pde,"""Mari found Boy Meets Girl imperfect, but also groundbreaking and heartwarming: 'Ricky is sweet and smart and quirky and cute, and I dare you all not to have a crush on her by the end of the film. She‚Äôs also a whole person, with feelings and dreams and heartbreaks and desires all her own that don‚Äôt necessarily have anything to do with being trans. While she is feminine, she‚Äôs far the hyper-femme stereotypes, with a definite tomboy spirit. She‚Äôs perhaps one of the most nuanced, least stereotypical trans characters that has ever been portrayed in film.'"""
46,Foxfire,1996,https://boxd.it/1GJo,"""If My So-Called Life took Dawson‚Äôs Creek out behind the gym and put a baby in it, and that baby was a slightly unhinged Angelia Jolie, it would be called Foxfire. Jenny Shimizu plays a lesbian and Angelina Jolie‚Äôs character is pretty queer, too ‚Äî the set of this film is where those two actresses fell in love and Jolie realized she was bisexual. The story of the close bonds groups of female friends from, especially in the face of adversity, is something we all understand on a bone-deep level."""
47,Set It Off,1996,https://boxd.it/1YMg,"""Four women fed up with the options available to them as black women band together to damn the man and perform their own bank heists. Queen Latifah plays lesbian character Cleo, and the film also shows the relationship between her and her girlfriend, Urusula. AfterEllen called it 'one of the greatest girl-power/female-solidarity flicks around and a true trend-starter from 1996.'"""
48,Mulholland Drive,2001,https://boxd.it/297o,"""It‚Äôs tough to describe this neo-noir mystery beyond alerting you that it‚Äôs a David Lynch film with a non-linear narrative and lots of twists and turns: complicated, weird, smart, compelling. Naomi Watts plays Betty Elms, an aspiring actress new to Los Angeles who becomes friends with Rita, an amnesic played by Laura Harring, who‚Äôs been hiding from the world in Elms‚Äô aunt‚Äôs apartment. Everything that happens next is too intense and bizarre to sum up, but rest assured: women have sex in this movie."""
49,Rent,2005,https://boxd.it/2844,"""Based on the long-running Broadway musical of the same name, Rent explores the lives of several East Village artists ‚Äî many of them queer ‚Äî living during the AIDS crisis in New York City in the late ‚Äô80s. The show-stopping 'Take Me (Or Leave Me)' is a rousing number between Maureen, a bisexual performance artist who loves to flirt and get wild, and her girlfriend, Joanne, a lawyer who loves lists and stability."""
50,Summertime,2015,https://boxd.it/8htk,"""This gorgeous film set in 1971 tells the story of a young woman from the French countryside who moves to Paris to get away from her parents, where she falls in with a group of politically engaged feminists and eventually falls in love with Carole, their leader."""
51,"Farewell, My Queen",2012,https://boxd.it/3pFI,"""If you‚Äôre looking for a fictional account of the last days of Marie Antoinette, in which she seduces the young woman who reads to her, well, this movie is for you! It features Diane Kruger and a pre-Blue Is the Warmest Color L√©a Seydoux as Sidonie Laborde, Marie Antoinette‚Äôs reader."""
52,Monster,2003,https://boxd.it/2afy,"""Based on the real-life story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, Monster is an Academy Award-winning crime drama about a sex worker who killed six men during the late ‚Äô80s and early ‚Äô90s. Charlize Theron plays Wuornos, and Christina Ricci plays Tyria Moore, Wuornos‚Äô girlfriend.!"""
53,Water Lilies,2007,https://boxd.it/1VjK,"""Perhaps more than any other film on this list, Water Lilies perfectly captures the heart-wrenching truth of sexual awakening, jealousy, and lust. And if that‚Äôs not enough to make you sit down with this gorgeous French film, how about the fact that Adele Haenel, who won a C√©sar Award for her portrayal of Floriane, fell in love with her female director Celine Sciamma on the set of Water Lilies and they‚Äôre still together to this very day?"""
54,Valencia,2013,https://boxd.it/7qv8,"""A once in a life time collaboration, Valencia The Movie/s is what happens when twenty-one (!) queer filmmakers each create a short film depicting one chapter of Michelle Tea‚Äôs 2000 Lambda Literary Award winning novel of the same name. It‚Äôs almost too cool to be believed, and Gabby declared it 'the most masterful dyke-centric artsy-weirdo film I‚Äôve ever seen.'"""
55,Fire,1996,https://boxd.it/2ae6,"""I‚Äôve heard it said that the best way to write a good story is to put your favorite character in a tree and throw rocks at them. For Radha and Sita, two Indian women stuck in loveless and demeaning marriages, rocks are the least of their problems. One of the first Indian film to explicitly portray homosexuality, Fire has faced an avalanche of controversy. Banned books (and films!) do it better."""
56,Stud Life,2012,https://boxd.it/5r0w,"""Not even an obviously teensy budget can break this gorgeously acted film about a stud finding love, grappling with shifting friendships, and figuring out what it means when the rules you set for yourself are the very things that stop you from getting what you want most."""
57,Concussion,2013,https://boxd.it/4VbM,"""When you were watching Mad Men, did you wish Maggie Siff would get off Don Draper‚Äôs D and get under a hot girl? If so, Concussion is the film for you!"""
58,Blue Is the Warmest Color,2013,https://boxd.it/4O40,"""Perhaps the most controversial lesbian film of this century, Blue Is the Warmest Color was decried as pornography by some, an exploitative film dominated by the male gaze by others and heralded as the greatest queer film of all time by others. It is based on the graphic novel of the same name, and while it embraces the coming of age queer themes of the source material, it zigs in a completely different direction in the end."""
59,First Girl I Loved,2016,https://boxd.it/bRy2,"""A Sundance award-winning coming-of-age film about a misfit who falls for the cute softball star at her high school ‚Äî and her best friend Clifton feels threatened by their budding connection. 'It captures the heart-pounding terror of becoming someone, the one-way nausea of committing to yourself,' writes Indiewire."""
60,The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love,1995,https://boxd.it/1nDc,"""Before she was The L Word‚Äòs Tina Kennard, Laurel Holloman landed on our screens as Randy Dean, an underachieving high school student who falls in love with an affluent girl from her high school. It‚Äôs so sweet and the ending is so happy it‚Äôs hard to believe this movie even exists, let alone was filmed a decade before The L Word."""
61,Young and Wild,2012,https://boxd.it/2Y0e,"""Despite being raised by strict Evangelicals, Daniela gets kicked out of her church for being a fornicator. Young and Wild may be a Chilean film, but its authenticity is universal. Nothing is tied up in a neat little bow, but then life rarely is. Daniela is sexy, gorgeous, and likes to kiss pretty girls. Count us in."""
62,The Four-Faced Liar,2010,https://boxd.it/QBC,"""Four-Faced Liar spends most of its time hanging out in an area that makes me every so slightly uncomfortable: straight girl in a committed relationship with a guy starts fooling around with the nearest lesbian. Too often, the lesbian is a screeching vulture flapping around the edges while the straight girl actually ends up with the boy, but Four-Faced Liar is actually nuanced enough to make it work."""
63,Pretty Persuasion,2005,https://boxd.it/1ODe,"""Evan Rachel Wood sparkles like a narcissistic little diamond in this mindfuck of a Mean Girls film. Pretty Persuasion hits all the triggers‚Äîsexual assault, racism, and suicide to name a few‚Äîand plenty more taboos besides. It‚Äôs got some important things to say about agency and sexuality, if you can make it through the racist rants to get there."""
64,AWOL,2016,https://boxd.it/c4Na,"‚Äú'Talking about class can be ugly,' wrote Sarah Fonseca in her glowing review of AWOL, a love story set in a rarely-portrayed rural landscape and confronts new conversations issues of class, race and gender. 'Yet as AWOL asserts, when you dare to comment, sometimes it frees up room for beauty to unfurl.'‚Äù"
65,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,2009,https://boxd.it/1Mb8,"""Adapted from Stieg Larsson‚Äôs best selling trilogy of novels, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo focuses on bisexual hacker Lisbeth Salander, who suffers brutal sexual abuse at the hands of her foster care supervisor and ultimately becomes the investigative partner of Mikael Blomkvist, a famous newspaper reporter who is hired by an eccentric millionaire to solve the decades old case of his missing granddaughter. Their trail leads them to (surprise!) more sexual abuse. (Larsson‚Äôs novel was titled Men Who Hate Women in the native Swedish version.)"""
66,Karmen Gei,2001,https://boxd.it/7rGm,"""Pansexual 'social outlaw' Karmen surprises her captors at a women‚Äôs prison when she seduces warden Angelique and flees for the Dakar underworld. Eventually, a love triangle emerges between Karmen, Angelique and police corporal Lamine and things get progressively more complicated from there."""
67,Heavenly Creatures,1994,https://boxd.it/2974,"""Peter Jackson‚Äôs critically acclaimed film details the obsessive (and ultimately) fatal relationship between Juliet and Pauline, who meet when they are 13 years old and fall in immediate love with each other. They spend most of their time writing about their fictional world, Borovnia, and projecting themselves into it. In real life, Juliet grew up to become famous novelist Anne Perry."""
68,Laurel Canyon,2002,https://boxd.it/1Plq,"Kate Beckinsale plays Alex, a young MD student who leaves her husband to get into a polyamorous relationship with her husband‚Äôs mom and his mom‚Äôs boyfriend. Writer/director Lisa Cholodenko says the film was inspired by the Joni Mitchel‚Äôs 'Ladies of the Canyon.'"""
69,The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister,2010,https://boxd.it/WCQ,"""Following the success of the miniseries Fingersmith and Tipping the Velvet, BBC filmed another queer period piece, this time about real-life lesbian lady Anne Lister. Lister was a Yorskshire landowner in the 19th century and an early industrialist. She also loved the ladies. The screenplay is based on the 4,000,000 words Lister wrote in her diaries in her lifetime. (The lesbian exploits were written in cipher!)"""
70,Spider Lilies,2007,https://boxd.it/VjS,"""Spider Lilies won the Teddy Award for Best Feature Film at the Berlin Film Festival. It tells the story of Jade, a cybersex worker, and Takeko, a tattoo artist, who awaken each other‚Äôs repressed sexuality and fall in love. Take that, cursed tattoo!"""
71,Blue Gate Crossing,2002,https://boxd.it/RhS,"""According to commenter Jelena, this ‚Äútender, unusual‚Äù story of a love triangle between two teenage girl best friends and a boy swimming champ features a refreshing and unexpected teen lesbian awakening."""
72,Lianna,1983,https://boxd.it/2I5i,"""Lianna is dated, absolutely. It hails from the same year Mr. T joined The A Team, for crying out loud. But the story of self-discovery and general gal-palling stands the test of time, even if you do have to put up with some really (really) bad hair to get to it."""
73,Personal Best,1982,https://boxd.it/1rpo,"""Fun fact: This is the movie Ellen cited as making her gay when she came out on her sitcom in 1997. This classic film tells the story of track and field star Chris Cahill who meets an more experienced athlete at the ‚Äô76 Olympic trials. Their gal pal-ness quickly turns to romance. Like most older lesbian films, it doesn‚Äôt have a happy ending."""
74,Yes or No,2010,https://boxd.it/cK,"""This Thai film looks at a relationship between two students from different backgrounds: Kim, a masculine-of-center lesbian, and Pie, who hails from a traditional family that doesn‚Äôt approve of gay people.

79,Signature Move,2017,https://boxd.it/fn7I,"""A Pakistani-American lawyer‚Äôs widowed mother has just moved in, and spends her days watching television and badgering her daughter about finding a nice man to marry. But Zaynab has other things on her mind ‚Äî like Alma, the Mexican-American woman she‚Äôs falling for. Alma‚Äôs mother, it turns out, is a former professional Luchadora, which is of great interest to Zaynab, who has just taken up wrestling herself."""
80,I Can't Think Straight,2008,https://boxd.it/1jAI,"""This is another film that lesbians either love or hate, but this is the film that opened our hearts forever Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth, as they played Tala and Leyla, two women from very different backgrounds that fall in love on accident. Tala is a Jordanian Palestinian woman living in London and planning her wedding. Leyla is a British-Indian who is dating Tala‚Äôs BFF. They fall in love, fall apart, and fall back together again. It‚Äôs very sweet and pretty dang sexy."""
81,The Truth About Jane,2000,https://boxd.it/y62,"""We loved Stockard Channing as Rizzo, and we loved her as First Lady Abigail Bartlett. Now we have to love her as a mother unable to believe that her daughter Jane is in fact not too pure to be pink. Stockard delivers yet another knockout performance in The Truth About Jane, earning a nomination from the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. This may have been the first queer movie you ever saw ‚Äî it was for many of us!"""
82,The Killing of Sister George,1968,https://boxd.it/tX6,"""Based on the 1964 play, The Killing of Sister George sees an aging television actress who has just lost her popular television role and is losing her relationship with a much younger woman. It was the first film to portray the interior of a lesbian nightclub. The film was given an X rating from the newly-formed MPAA due to its lesbian content, and thus failed at the box office. In The UK and Italy, some lesbian scenes were cut. The lesbian stereotypes prevalent in this film did none of us one single favor."""
83,M√§dchen in Uniform,1931,https://boxd.it/1Y8g,"""Considered by many to be the first lesbian film, M√§dchen in Uniform explores the relationship between a teenage boarding school student and one of her female teachers.

84,Kissing Jessica Stein,2001,https://boxd.it/1LPc,"""Jessica Stein is frustrated by her dating experiences with men and decides to give women a shot when she connects with another woman who‚Äôs also never been in a lesbian relationship before.

89,Red Doors,2005,https://boxd.it/1EMU,"""Red Doors tells the story of Ed Wong, a Chinese-American retiree who is coming to terms with his three daughters growing up. One of his daughters, Julie, falls in love with an actress. They struggle to reconcile their sexuality with their parents‚Äô demands on their romantic lives."""
90,Lovesong,2016,https://boxd.it/cSSY,"""Sarah, a young mother left lonely by her marriage, is talked into a road trip with her college friend, Mindy, and their intense longtime friendship is shot through with 'stolen kisses and college confessions [that] indicate there‚Äôs so much more between Sarah and Mindy than a best friendship.'"""
91,Drool,2009,https://boxd.it/1cRC,"""A dark comedy that touches on abuse, assault and murder, but manages to be fun about it all."""
92,The Summer of Sangaile,2015,https://boxd.it/9Y74,"""Summer love blooms between two teenagers in Lithuania who meet at an aerobatics show ‚Äî a girl who dreams of being a pilot who‚Äôs spending the summer at her family‚Äôs lake house and the bohemian photographer and clothing designer she‚Äôs drawn to."""
93,The Intervention,2016,https://boxd.it/bO52,"""Clea Duvall directed this weekend-at-the-summer-house film about four couples of mostly old friends who plan a weekend away together to stage an 'intervention' on one of the couples, who they‚Äôve agreed needs to divorce. Obviously over the course of the weekend we realize that all these couples are dysfunctional and probably shouldn‚Äôt judge. It‚Äôs worth it to see Clea Duvall and Natasha Lyonne play a couple again and just to witness excellent performances from your favorite actresses, although the film‚Äôs central conceit never really earns its existence and the backstories of the characters often ring a little hollow."""
94,Rough Night,2017,https://boxd.it/dV0W,"""There‚Äôs a lot about this film, on the surface, that might turn you off ‚Äî but if you give it a chance, you might be surprised by how those things actually play out! Yes, the writing is often clumsy and there are some annoying, ridiculous plot holes. But it‚Äôs also a cute, funny and surprisingly feminist movie entirely about women with a non-chalant lesbian front-and-center (played by Ilana Glazer) who gets one of the film‚Äôs only rewarding romantic storylines."""
95,The Hunger,1983,https://boxd.it/1Tk2,"""Lesbian vampires? Check. Susan Sarandon? Check. David Bowie? Check. Major shoutout in The Miseducation of Cameron Post? CHECK CHECK CHECK."""
96,Who's Afraid of Vagina Wolf?,2013,https://boxd.it/6bgK,"""A little bit quirky, and a little bit navel-gazey, this grown-up comedy looks at what it means to really have it all. Plus it has an all-female cast, one of whom literally romps around on stage wearing a vagina costume. If that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre looking for in a film, you‚Äôre on the wrong list, my friend."""
97,Liz in September,2014,https://boxd.it/8X0a,"""An adaptation of the American play Last Summer in Bluefish Cove that stars model/actress Patricia Vel√°squez as Liz, who takes a liking to Eva, a traveler whose car broke down nearby, landing her at the hotel owned by Liz‚Äôs friend Margot.

Variety wrote that 'this handsome romantic drama will be a crowdpleaser primarily among lesbian audiences in various formats.'"""
98,BFFs,2014,https://boxd.it/81I4,"""This fun buddy-movie-slash-romcom 'takes female-driven to a whole new level,' according to out comedian Brittani Nichols, who wrote in her review of the film, 'It‚Äôs a narrative that opens the doors for the discussion of sexual fluidity without making it corny or annoying and the best part of all is it‚Äôs funny.' It‚Äôs the story of two friends who fake being a couple to use a free trip to a Couples Retreat and discover while pretending to be girlfriends that there might be more to their friendship than they previously considered."""
99,My Mother Likes Women,2002,https://boxd.it/3ngG,"""Long-divorced Sophia gathers her three daughters to share the news that she‚Äôs fallen in love! Hurrah! That love is the sapphic sort. Not-so-Hurrah."""
100,Daphne,2007,https://boxd.it/68HI,"""Daphne is exactly the film you need, if the thing you‚Äôre missing from your life is Downton Abby‚Äôs Elizabeth McGovern in a depressing-as-fuck period drama about the unrequited lady loves of novelist Daphne DuMauier."""

102,Almost Adults,2016,https://boxd.it/c6mK,"""A cute film that delivers some light charm with minimal offensiveness, starring Elise Bauman of Carmilla as lesbian tomboy femme Mackenzie and Natasha Negovanlis as her best friend Cassie, the last girl in the world not to notice that Mack is gay as hell."""
103,Love My Life,2006,https://boxd.it/118G,"""Based off the josei manga by Ebine Yamaji, Love My Life was a favorite of many commenters on our original list. 'The joy of the film, aside from the relationship between the main character and her girlfriend,' Rhea said, 'is the one between her and her father as she learns more about him and her mother‚Äôs past.'"
104,Portrait of a Serial Monogamist,2015,https://boxd.it/aXu4,"""Elsie is a forty-year-old Jewish lesbian in Toronto who‚Äî after getting her heart broken at the tender age of 12 ‚Äî has bounced from serious relationship to serious relationship all her life, refusing to be single and perfecting her exit strategy.

105,When Night Is Falling,1995,https://boxd.it/20eK,"""'My favourite film simply because it unashamedly clings to an impossible optimism,' wrote commenter Marriane. 'I mean, come on ‚Ä¶ the dog comes back to life to the strains of the Hallelujah chorus. It was this kind of optimism that saw marriage equality germinate, take root and flower.'"""
106,"Bumblefuck, USA",2011,https://boxd.it/40Ik,"""Alexa moves from Amsterdam to a small U.S. town to film a documentary to help her make sense of her gay best friend‚Äôs suicide.

108,Tru Love,2013,https://boxd.it/88hu,"""The May/December romance at the heart of Tru Love is but one of the many complex relationships in this surprisingly layered film. Winner of nearly a dozen awards across the U.S., Canada, Ireland, and India, Tru Love might just make you want to believe in soul mates. Or fall asleep. Depends on your style."""
109,Better Than Chocolate,1999,https://boxd.it/1HmA,"""Better Than Chocolate is not without flaws. It‚Äôs cliched and over-the-top; there‚Äôs a trans woman character played by a cis man; and the poster looks like some kind of Lisa Frank fever-dream, all of which we can probably chalk up to it being a film from the ‚Äô90s. If you can get around that, you can enjoy this endearing and charming love story about a girl who drops out of college to work at a lesbian bookstore, much to the adorable confusion of her chocolate-addicted mother. Fun fact: the actor who played the trans woman character also played Bob Corbett on Bomb Girls and Henrik on Orphan Black."""
110,It's in the Water,1997,https://boxd.it/1Ctm,"""In It‚Äôs In The Water, the whole town of Azalea Springs, Texas loses its damn mind when someone makes an offhand comment about having their water tested for The Gay. This film hits all the 90‚Äôs queer g-spots: beards, leather bars, AIDS, and anti-gay protesters foaming at the mouth. Plus some ladies making out in a supply closet, if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing."""
111,My Friend from Faro,2008,https://boxd.it/1RDw,"""Just your classic German tale of a tomboy who assumes the identity of a Portuguese guy named Miguel after she plows down a pretty girl in the street."""
112,Gray Matters,2006,https://boxd.it/1Ngy,"""Heather Graham stars in this cheesy, adorable rom-com about a ballroom dancer who falls in love with her brother‚Äôs girlfriend."""
113,Puccini for Beginners,2006,https://boxd.it/1Dy8,"""This ‚Äúscrewball comedy of sexual confusion with lesbian inclinations‚Äù was made by Maria Maggenti, who also made The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls In Love. It‚Äôs not a masterpiece, but out actress Sarah Croce and her two friends enjoyed watching it while eating Italian food, so."""
114,Entre Nous,1983,https://boxd.it/XIU,"""This story of two young married women who realize how unfulfilled they are in their marriages when they fall in love with each other takes place in the 1950s, with flashbacks set in World War II, when one of the women was placed in an internment camp for Jews. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film."""
115,A Perfect Ending,2012,https://boxd.it/3CS6,"""Nicole Conn is a prolific lesbian filmmaker and, to be honest, usually her name on a title is a pretty good indication that we‚Äôre not watching a good movie. But a lot of queer women swear by her movies and love the heck out of ‚Äôem so we felt obligated to include at least one! If Pretty Woman had a baby gay baby with Nicholas Sparks, the result would be A Perfect Ending, a drama about a call girl with a heart of gold and an artist‚Äôs temperament who falls in love with a ‚Äústraight‚Äù WASPy housewife who is dying of cancer. The ending may be perfect, but it‚Äôs sad as heck."""
116,Girltrash: All Night Long,2014,https://boxd.it/7v3e,"""There was a lot of drama around the release of this film, and we do stand with Angela Robinson, who did not approve the final cut of the movie. But it‚Äôs still pretty cute and worth a mention ‚Äî it‚Äôs a rock musical chock-full of ladies you love to see play gay, like the lead actresses from South of Nowhere and Kate French, Malaya Rivera Drew, Clementine Ford and Rose Rollins from The L Word."""
117,Go Fish,1994,https://boxd.it/1GBu,"""It‚Äôs a classic. It holds a special place in the hearts of so many lesbians who remember a time when this was all there was, and its legend leaves many modern viewers stuck scratching their heads about why it was ever a thing. Well: while coming out stories are wildly important, it‚Äôs always lovely to see a lesbian story that focuses on what happens next. Go Fish is a fun, spunky film about the frustrating experience of finding love, even when it‚Äôs right under your nose."""
118,Below Her Mouth,2016,https://boxd.it/cQVQ,"""This film earned high marks for going all-in with lesbian sex, and gets a spot on this list for that alone, despite being, at times, utterly insufferable. However, if we‚Äôd seen this in high school when we were figuring out our sexualities and weren‚Äôt already bored by its stale tropes, excruciating dialogue and the utter cliche of the lead character, it‚Äôd probably change our lives and make us all the lesbians we are today; but much earlier!"""
119,Lost and Delirious,2001,https://boxd.it/1Ina,"""Most of us agree that this film was terrible, but its not without its merits. Like that cast, and those uniforms?"""
