2020-01-01,Official Top 100 Narrative Feature Films by Women Directors,"letterboxd, official top 100, women directors, allstats",https://boxd.it/4ts1Q,"Ranked by average user rating. The list was extracted thanks to <a href=""https://admin.letterboxd.com/thaizy/list/directed-by-women/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://admin.letterboxd.com/michaelhaneke/list/films-directed-by-women/"" rel=""nofollow"">here.</a> This was not possible without the curation of these megalists. It will be updated monthly.

An official list progress project on all-time stats pages for Pro and Patron users. <a href=""https://news.letterboxd.com/post/188461808723/top-100-women-directors"" rel=""nofollow"">Read LWLies, Sight & Sound, Empire, and NME critic Ella Kemp's deep-dive into the list here!</a>

<i>ELIGIBILITY RULES:</i>

• This list counts female co-directors, even if uncredited. The developers are working towards co-directors getting their credit listed on main pages. 
• Includes cis, transgender and female-identifying directors.
• Films must be feature-length (45+ minutes), with a theatrical and/or festival release. 
• Documentaries of any kind, short films, theater/stage, TV movies, TV series or miniseries, and episodes are excluded. 
• There is a 1,000 minimum view threshold.

<i>NOTABLE INCLUSIONS:</i>

• The #2 on the list, <i>City of God</i> was co-directed by Kátia Lund. However, Lund was snubbed for the Academy Award while only Fernando Meirelles was nominated due to their rules about director teams. Meirelles and Lund worked together closely, directing the short <i>Golden Gate</i> in 2001 together as a test run for <i>City of God</i>. They then collaborated on the <i>City of Men</i> TV series adapted from <i>City of God</i> where she directed 4 episodes. 
• <i>Werckmeister Harmonies</i> and <i>The Turin Horse</i> were co-directed by Bela Tarr's wife and editor Ágnes Hranitzky. The credit developed because of the extent Hranitzky had to be on set to assist Tarr with the timings of his long takes in order to match other shots. She edited all his films since 1981 but the credit only began in 2000. I am not mistaking Bela to be a woman.
• While they are currently the only transgender directors in the list, <i>The Matrix</i> is valid regardless of how the Wachowski siblings publically identified as at the time. Transgender women were always women, no matter which body parts they were born with.
• Jacques Rivette's <i>Out 1</i> was co-directed by his screenwriting partner <i>Suzanne Schiffman</i>.

Please feel free to let me know any movies I've missed. 

Warning: If you did not get this far in the description and you leave a thoughtless comment such as ""Bela Tarr is a man"" then it will be removed. You can ask ""Who is the credited female director on The Turin Horse?"" but don't phrase your question the other way.
